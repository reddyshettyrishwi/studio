# **App Name**: Nxthub

## Core Features:

- Centralized Influencer Repository: A unified database for storing influencer data, including names, platform, category, language, channel links, contact info, and last promotion details. Includes manual data entry and CSV uploads.
- AI-Assisted Duplicate Detection: Use AI to detect duplicate influencer profiles based on mobile number and legal name (PAN), flagging potential duplicates based on channel name/link similarity. Use LLM to analyze similar profile links. This feature will be implemented as a tool.
- Influencer Scouting & Onboarding Workflow: Streamline the process of adding new influencers, tracking agency vs. direct contacts, and notifying relevant POCs if a new influencer matches an existing record.
- Campaign Reference Data Logging: Log campaign associations with influencers, including campaign name, department, deliverables, date, price paid, and average views. Enable cross-team visibility to avoid duplicate promotions or inflated pricing.
- Access Control with Role-Based Permissions: Implement platform-wide access for all departments with filter-based views and role-based permissions (Associate / Manager / Head). Mask sensitive details until approved by Level 2 or above.
- Smart Alerts & Validation: Automatically alert if a newly proposed influencer/campaign exceeds previous price benchmarks significantly and notify users when existing influencer data appears outdated or inactive.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0B8FF) to evoke a sense of creativity and sophistication relevant to the influencer landscape. The color suggests a modern and approachable platform.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), subtly desaturated, to ensure content clarity and a clean interface. The low saturation and high brightness avoid distracting from the colorful content expected from influencers.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#E6A9EC), an analogous hue, with a softer touch in both brightness and saturation, to create highlights without overpowering the lavender theme.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif well-suited to headlines or short chunks of text. Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) is suitable for longer stretches of text. It complements the personality in the primary font.
- Use clear, modern icons representing various social media platforms, campaign metrics, and user roles.
- Design a clean, intuitive layout with a focus on data presentation and ease of navigation. Utilize card-based layouts for influencer profiles and campaign data.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and transitions to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
