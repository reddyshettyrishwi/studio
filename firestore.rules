/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for InfluenceWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and allows controlled
 * access to agencies, influencers, and campaigns based on association and denormalized data.
 * Access control is managed through path-based ownership for users and association with agencies and influencers for other entities.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the authenticated user.
 * - /agencies/{agencyId}: Stores agency profiles, access managed through role-based permissions.
 * - /influencers/{influencerId}: Stores influencer profiles, access controlled by association with an agency (agencyId).
 * - /campaigns/{campaignId}: Stores campaign data, access based on association with influencers (influencerIds).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly private to the owning user.
 * - Listing of user profiles is disallowed.
 * - Access to influencers and campaigns is based on association with agencies and influencers, respectively.
 * - Data denormalization (agencyId in influencers, influencerIds in campaigns) is used to simplify security rules and avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `influencers` documents have a denormalized `agencyId` field. This allows rules to check if the logged-in user has access to a specific agency.
 * - The `campaigns` documents have a denormalized `influencerIds` array. This allows rules to check if the logged-in user has access to the relevant influencers without retrieving related campaign details.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - This ruleset currently does not need data to be both private and public.
